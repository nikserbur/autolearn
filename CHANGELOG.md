## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-27

### Added
- `/feature` multi-agent pipeline: docs-scout, code-scout, planner, plan-critic, implementer,
  test-writer, code-reviewer (review + refutation), doc-writer, merge-gate, lessons-keeper;
  light / deep / two-stage modes; verify gate; learned extra reviewers.
- Learning loop: `capture_feedback` hook, `/learn`, `/retro` with `al-escape-analyst`, promotion
  ladder (test > hook > rule > prompt patch > new reviewer / skill), human-approved proposals.
- Knowledge base built with its router: `kb-router` (`kb_route.py`), `kb-ingest` (`kb_lint.py`),
  topic map with section pointers, two-level maps, router hit/miss log.
- `/skill-radar` with `scan_sessions.py`, `inventory.py` and the `al-skill-scout` agent.
- `colleague-message`, `pr-description`, `git-handoff`, `/merge-check`.
- Hooks: `check_secrets`, `session_brief`, `verify_gate`, `test_output_filter`, `planner_guard`.
- Safe `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` (stops on name clashes, restores your files, merges its
  manifest across runs, dereferences symlinks in backups); plugin mode seeds the data directory
  on the first session; plugin and marketplace manifests, `scripts/validate.py`, CI.
- All agents are prefixed `al-` to avoid collisions with other setups; plugin-mode hooks act
  only for `autolearn:al-*` agents.
- No hook auto-approves: guards deny with a reason and the exact fix.
- Feedback capture in 15 languages (`templates/feedback-patterns.json`, seeded to the data
  directory), each language tested with positive and neutral examples.
- Docs: [components](docs/components.md) reference and a dated, side-by-side
  [comparison](docs/comparison.md) with related projects.
